\section{Introduction}

In the analysis of beams under various loading conditions, it is essential to determine the shear force $V(x)$ and the bending moment $M(x)$ along the beam. These functions are derived from the applied load distribution $q(x)$ by means of equilibrium considerations. In many 2nd-year mechanics of materials courses, several integration techniques are used to handle both continuous and discontinuous loadings. In this document, we review these methods in detail and provide usage examples for each method as applied to shear and moment diagrams.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Fundamental Equations}

For a beam loaded along its length (with $x$ as the coordinate along the beam), the differential equilibrium equations are usually written as
\begin{align}
  \frac{dV}{dx} &= -q(x), \label{eq:dv_dx} \\
  \frac{dM}{dx} &= V(x). \label{eq:dM_dx}
\end{align}
The negative sign in \eqref{eq:dv_dx} is due to the common sign convention that a positive distributed load $q(x)$ (acting downward) produces a negative change in shear force.

Integrating \eqref{eq:dv_dx} from a reference point $x_0$ to an arbitrary point $x$, we obtain
\begin{equation}
  V(x) = V(x_0) - \int_{x_0}^{x} q(\xi)\, d\xi.
  \label{eq:V_integral}
\end{equation}

Similarly, integrating \eqref{eq:dM_dx} from $x_0$ to $x$ yields
\begin{equation}
  M(x) = M(x_0) + \int_{x_0}^{x} V(\xi)\, d\xi.
  \label{eq:M_integral}
\end{equation}

These equations form the basis for constructing shear and moment diagrams.

\section{Integration Techniques and Examples}

When the load $q(x)$ is simple (e.g., constant or linear), the integrals in \eqref{eq:V_integral} and \eqref{eq:M_integral} can be computed directly. More complex beam problems often involve discontinuities (such as point loads or moments) or piecewise-defined loads. The following techniques are commonly used:

\subsection{Direct Integration for Continuous Loads}
\textbf{Usage Example in Mechanics of Materials:} \\
For a uniformly distributed load (UDL) where
\[
q(x) = q_0,
\]
choose the left end $x_0=0$ with known shear $V(0)$ and moment $M(0)$. Directly integrating, the shear force becomes:
\[
V(x) = V(0) - \int_{0}^{x} q_0\, d\xi = V(0) - q_0 x.
\]
Then, the moment is obtained by integrating the shear:
\[
M(x) = M(0) + \int_{0}^{x} \left[ V(0) - q_0\,\xi \right] d\xi = M(0) + V(0)x - \frac{q_0}{2} x^2.
\]
This method is straightforward when the load function is continuous.

\subsection{Integration by Splitting the Domain}
\textbf{Usage Example in Mechanics of Materials:} \\
Consider a beam with a piecewise-defined load:
\[
q(x) = \begin{cases}
q_1(x) & \text{for } 0 \le x < a, \\
q_2(x) & \text{for } a \le x \le L.
\end{cases}
\]
For $x \ge a$, the shear force is computed by splitting the integration domain:
\[
V(x) = V(0) - \int_{0}^{a} q_1(\xi)\, d\xi - \int_{a}^{x} q_2(\xi)\, d\xi.
\]
Similarly, the moment diagram is constructed by integrating the shear force, taking care to split the integration at $x=a$ where the load function changes.

\subsection{Incorporating Point Loads Using the Heaviside and Dirac Delta Functions}
\textbf{Usage Example in Mechanics of Materials:} \\
Suppose a beam carries a point load $P$ applied at $x=a$. Represent the load as
\[
q(x) = P\,\delta(x-a).
\]
Then, using the sifting property of the delta function:
\[
\int_{0}^{x} P\,\delta(\xi-a)\, d\xi = P\,H(x-a),
\]
where
\[
H(x-a) = \begin{cases}
0, & x < a, \\
1, & x \ge a.
\end{cases}
\]
The shear force becomes:
\[
V(x) = V(0) - P\,H(x-a),
\]
indicating a jump (discontinuity) in the shear force at $x=a$. The bending moment is then found by integrating $V(x)$ while properly accounting for the discontinuity at the point load.

\subsection{The Macaulay Bracket Notation}
\textbf{Usage Example in Mechanics of Materials:} \\
When multiple discontinuities are present (for example, several point loads or load changes), Macaulay’s bracket notation simplifies the expressions. For a load “turning on” at $x=a$, the shear or moment expressions can be written as:
\[
M(x) = M(0) + V(0)x - \frac{q_0}{2}x^2 - P\langle x - a \rangle^1.
\]
Since the derivative of $\langle x - a \rangle^1$ with respect to $x$ is $\langle x - a \rangle^0 = H(x-a)$, differentiating $M(x)$ recovers the shear force:
\[
V(x) = \frac{dM}{dx} = V(0) - q_0 x - P\,H(x-a).
\]
The compact notation automatically “activates” the load effect only when $x\ge a$.

\subsection{Integration by Parts}
\textbf{Usage Example in Mechanics of Materials:} \\
While many beam problems yield polynomial expressions that are easily integrated, in cases where the load function is a product of functions (for example, when dealing with variable loads multiplied by an exponential or trigonometric function), integration by parts may be necessary. Recall the formula:
\[
\int u(x)\,dv(x) = u(x)v(x) - \int v(x)\,du(x).
\]
This technique can be applied when the load function $q(x)$ is not a simple polynomial, ensuring that the integration is carried out correctly to obtain $V(x)$ and $M(x)$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Examples}

\subsection{Example 1: Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL)}
Consider a beam with a UDL of intensity $q_0$ acting over its entire length. With the left end $x=0$ as the reference (where $V(0)$ and $M(0)$ are known), we have:
\[
V(x) = V(0) - q_0\, x,
\]
and
\[
M(x) = M(0) + \int_0^x \left[ V(0) - q_0\,\xi \right] d\xi = M(0) + V(0)x - \frac{q_0}{2}x^2.
\]
This illustrates the direct integration method.

\subsection{Example 2: Beam with a Point Load}
Suppose a beam carries a point load $P$ at $x=a$. Represent the load as:
\[
q(x) = P\,\delta(x-a).
\]
Then for $x\ge 0$,
\[
V(x) = V(0) - \int_0^x P\,\delta(\xi-a)\, d\xi = V(0) - P\,H(x-a),
\]
which means the shear force jumps by $P$ at $x=a$. The moment is then given by:
\[
M(x) = M(0) + \int_0^x V(\xi)\, d\xi,
\]
where the integration is split at $x=a$ to account for the discontinuity. This is an application of incorporating point loads using the Dirac delta and Heaviside functions.

\subsection{Example 3: Using Macaulay Notation}
Consider a beam subject to a load that “activates” at $x=a$. The moment expression can be written compactly as:
\[
M(x) = M(0) + V(0)x - \frac{q_0}{2}x^2 - P\langle x - a \rangle^1.
\]
Differentiating yields the shear force:
\[
V(x) = \frac{dM}{dx} = V(0) - q_0\,x - P\,H(x-a),
\]
demonstrating the ease of handling discontinuities with Macaulay’s bracket.

\section{Summary and Conclusion}

The construction of shear and moment diagrams in beam theory relies on integrating the load function using the relationships
\[
\frac{dV}{dx} = -q(x) \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{dM}{dx} = V(x).
\]
For simple continuous loads, direct integration suffices. When loads are discontinuous or include concentrated forces, splitting the integration domain or using generalized functions (the Dirac delta and Heaviside functions) becomes necessary. The Macaulay bracket notation further streamlines the process by automatically “turning on” terms only where needed. Finally, integration by parts remains a useful tool for more complex load functions.

These integration techniques not only aid in constructing accurate shear and moment diagrams but also deepen the understanding of the beam’s response under various loading conditions.
